From these statements, SQLDelight will generate a `Database` class with an associated `Schema`
object that can be used to create your database and execute statements on it. The `Database` class
is generated by the `generateSqlDelightInterface` Gradle task which is run automatically by the
SQLDelight IDE plugin when you edit a `.sq` file, and also as part of a normal Gradle build.
