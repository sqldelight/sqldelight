When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) . SQLDelight If you're looking to get started with contributing, look below for specific guides depending on which part of SQLDelight you'd like to contribute to. If you're still unsure, comment in the issue you're looking in to with where you're getting stuck and we'll respond there - or create an issue for the thing you're trying to do and start the discussion. IDE Plugin If you want to fix a bug or extend the IDE, code changes will likely happen in the sqldelight-idea-plugin module. You can test your changes using the ./gradlew runIde task and you can live debug using ./gradlew runIde --debug-jvm . If you're encountering a bug in the IDE but cannot reproduce it in a sample project, you can live debug your IDE. You'll need a second installation of IntelliJ to do this. You can use Toolbox to do this by scrolling to the bottom of the IDE list and selecting a different version of IntelliJ. In the IDE you'd like to use the debugger in, check out the SQLDelight repo and then create a new Remote Run Configuration. It will already populate \"Command line arguments for remote JVM\", something like -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 . Copy that value, then open the IDE you would like to debug. Select Help -> Edit Custom VM Options , and paste the line you copied to the bottom of the file that is opened. Restart the IDE you want to debug, then once it's started up open the IDE you created the configuration in, and attach the debugger using the remote configuration you created. For more information on building IDE plugins and features for them see the Official Jetbrains Documentation or join the Jetbrains Platform Slack . Drivers If you're interested in creating your own driver, you can do so outside of the SQLDelight repository using the runtime artifact. To test the driver you can depend on the driver-test and extend DriverTest and TransactionTest to ensure it works as SQLDelight would expect. Gradle If you're encountering a gradle issue, start by creating a test fixture in sqldelight-gradle-plugin/src/test similar to the other folders there which reproduces your issue. Feel free to just open a PR with this failing test if you don't know how to fix! Test cases are greatly appreciated. The integration tests show how to set up an entire gradle project which will run SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc and execute SQL queries using their respective runtime environments and SQLDelight. Consider adding a test to these already existing integration tests if you're encountering runtime issues in SQLDelight. Compiler There are many layers to SQLDelight's compiler - if you are strictly interested in the codegen (and not the parsing of SQL) then you will want to make your contributions in the sqldelight-compiler module. If you are interested in the parser you'll need to contribute to sql-psi . SQLDelight uses kotlinpoet for generating kotlin code, be sure to use it's APIs for referencing kotlin types so imports still work correctly. If you modify the codegen in any way, run a ./gradlew build before opening a pull request, as it will update the integration test in sqldelight-compiler:integration-tests . If you'd like to write an integration test (meaning running SQL queries in a runtime environment), add a test to sqldelight-compiler:integration-tests . SQL PSI In the next section we will go through how to contribute to the parser and PSI layer, but before doing that you should read a blog post on multiple dialects to understand the various moving pieces in sql-psi . As with SQLDelight, if you're encountering an issue but don't know how to contribute a fix or need assistance, comment in the GitHub issue or create a new one to start the discussion. For any changes in SQL-PSI, you will want to add a test fixture in the corresponding core/src/test/fixtures_* folder. The fixtures folder (no suffix) runs for all dialects. After your change has been merged to sql-psi, if there are changes you also need to make in SQLDelight, check out the sql-psi-dev branch on SQLDelight and target it with your PR. It uses the snapshot releases of sql-psi so you can build your SQLDelight change roughly 10 minutes after the sql-psi change has been merged. Grammar If you are adding to the grammar, first decide if this is a new rule you are adding to an existing grammar, or a rule you would like to override from ANSI SQL (which is found in sql.bnf ). In both cases, you will want to define that rule in your new grammar, but in the case of overriding an ANSI SQL rule, add it to the overrides list and set the override attribute on the rule: overrides ::= my_rule my_rule ::= SOME_TOKEN { override = true } The definition of your rule should start by being an exact copy/paste of the rule from ANSI-SQL. To reference rules from ANSI-SQL, you need to surround it in {}, so you should surround all external rules in your overriding rule with {}: my_rule ::= internal_rule {external_rule} { override = true } internal_rule ::= SOME_TOKEN One caveat is that referencing the expr rule from ANSI-SQL should look like <<expr '-1'>> because it is special and cannot be overridden. Any tokens that you want to use from ANSI SQL should also be manually imported: { parserImports = [ \"static com.alecstrong.sql.psi.core.psi.SqlTypes.DELETE\" \"static com.alecstrong.sql.psi.core.psi.SqlTypes.FROM\" ] } overrides ::= delete delete ::= DELETE FROM {table_name} { override = true } Dialects cannot add their own tokens, but you can require exact text by surrounding it with \"\": my_rule ::= \"SOME_TOKEN\" Overriding rules must still generate code which confirms to the original rules types, so make sure to implement and extend the existing types for the original rule: my_rule ::= internal_rule {external_rule} { extends = \"com.alecstrong.sql.psi.core.psi.impl.SqlMyRuleImpl\" implements = \"com.alecstrong.sql.psi.core.psi.SqlMyRule\" overrides = true } To see an example of overriding rules in the grammar, check out this pr which adds RETURNING syntax to PostgreSQL. Rule Behavior Often times you want to modify the behavior of the PSI layer (for example throwing errors for situations you want to fail compilation for). To do this, have your rule use a mixin instead of an extends which is a class you write containing that new logic: my_rule ::= interal_rule {external_rule} { mixin = \"com.alecstrong.sql.psi.MyRuleMixin\" implements = \"com.alecstrong.sql.psi.core.psi.SqlMyRule\" overrides = true } And then in that class ensure that it implements the original ANSI SQL type and the SQL-PSI base class SqlCompositeElementImpl : class MyRule( node: ASTNode ) : SqlCompositeElementImpl(node), SqlMyRule { fun annotate(annotationHolder: SqlAnnotationHolder) { if (internal_rule.text == \"bad_text\") { annotationHolder.createErrorAnnotation(\"Invalid text value\", internal_rule) } } } For example, the DropIndexMixin verifies the index being dropped exists in the schema.

This will upgrade the arch.persistence.db dependency to 1.1.1, but should have no effect on your usage of sqldelight. Upgrade the gradle plugin from 0.7.1 to 0.7.2. This changes the runtime package from com.squareup.sqldelight to com.squareup.sqldelight.prerelease , so you will need to change references in your own code. Upgrade the gradle plugin from 0.7.2 to 0.9.0. This upgrades the transitive dependencies and generated code to instead use AndroidX, which is a requirement of SQLDelight. This should be done at the same time as you upgrading your own project to AndroidX, and cannot be done separately since SQLDelight generates code which references android support/AndroidX. ALTERNATIVELY Upgrade the gradle plugin from 0.7 to 0.8.0 before then upgrading to 0.9.0. This upgrades to AndroidX without changing the sqldelight package name to com.squareup.sqldelight.prerelease Suppose on SQLDelight 0.9 you have this User.sq file: CREATE TABLE user ( id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , name TEXT NOT NULL ); insertDefaultData : INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 1 , 'Alec' ); users : SELECT * FROM user ; names : SELECT name FROM user ; insertUser : INSERT INTO user VALUES ( ? , ? ); This will generate the UserModel class with methods for your queries. Copy and paste all *Model.java files out of the build directory and into your src/main/java folder. Upgrade the gradle plugin from 0.9 to 1.0.0-rc4. Note your build will fail at this point because of the model code having undefined references to the old SQL Delight runtime (like SqlDelightStatement ). To add these back in add an implementation dependency on com.squareup.sqldelight:runtime:0.9.0 . At this point your build should still be working, but changes to .sq files will not be reflected in your *Model.java files. If things aren't working at this point, please file an issue! Begin by modifying your SupportSQLiteOpenHelper.Callback to call into the now generated Database which holds generated code for SQL Delight 1.0: //Before @Override void onCreate ( SupportSQLiteDatabase db ) { db . execSql ( UserModel . CREATE_TABLE ); db . execSql ( UserModel . INSERTDEFAULTDATA ); // Other create table/initialization } In SQL Delight 1.0 all unlabeled statements in .sq files (including CREATE statements) will be run during onCreate , so we can remove the insertDefaultData identifier from above: User.sq ... --insertDefaultData: INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 1 , 'Alec' ); ... and now your SupportSQLiteOpenHelper.Callback should call into the Database for create @Override void onCreate ( SupportSQLiteDatabase db ) { SqlDriver driver = AndroidSqliteDriver ( db ) Database . Schema . create ( driver ) } You can do the same for your migrations if you place them in .sqm files, but thats not necessary part of the upgrade. At this point things should still work normally. Next add in the code to create your Database as part of an object graph/singleton pattern/whevs: @Provides @Singleton static SupportSQLiteOpenHelper provideDatabaseHelper ( @App Context context ) { SupportSQLiteOpenHelper . Configuration config = SupportSQLiteOpenHelper . Configuration . builder ( context ) . name ( DATABASE_NAME ) . callback ( new MyDatabaseCallback ()) . build (); return new FrameworkSQLiteOpenHelperFactory (). create ( config ); } @Provides @Singleton static Database provideDatabase ( SupportSQLiteOpenHelper helper ) { return new Database ( new AndroidSqliteDriver ( helper )); } If you're also using SQL Brite make sure you create a BriteDatabase with the same SupportSQLiteOpenHelper that's being used to create the Database . Things should still be working. The following assume you're using SQL Brite to get reactive callbacks from the database, but upgrades using only SQL Delight will be similar. Mutating queries can be converted individually by using the Database : before: private val insertUser : UserModel . InsertUser by lazy { UserModel . InsertUser ( datbaseOpenHelper . writableDatabase ) } insertUser . bind ( 2 , \"Jake\" ) insertUser . executeInsert () after: database . userQueries . insertUser ( 2 , \"Jake\" ) You no longer need a \"Factory\" type to perform queries, the query wrapper is all that is needed. before: val query = User . FACTORY . users () val usersObservable = briteDatabase . createQuery ( query . tables , query . statement , query . args ) . mapToList ( User . FACTORY . usersMapper () :: map ) after: val usersObservable = database . userQueries . users () . asObservable ( Schedulers . io ()) // The scheduler to run the query on. . mapToList () If you still want to use a custom type, pass it as a parameter to the query. val myUsersObservable = database . userQueries . users ( :: MyUser ) . asObservable ( Schedulers . io ()) . mapToList () Once you no longer have references to UserModel.java , delete the whole class.

Copy and paste all *Model.java files out of the build directory and into your src/main/java folder. Upgrade the gradle plugin from 0.9 to 1.0.0-rc4. Note your build will fail at this point because of the model code having undefined references to the old SQL Delight runtime (like SqlDelightStatement ). To add these back in add an implementation dependency on com.squareup.sqldelight:runtime:0.9.0 . At this point your build should still be working, but changes to .sq files will not be reflected in your *Model.java files. If things aren't working at this point, please file an issue! Begin by modifying your SupportSQLiteOpenHelper.Callback to call into the now generated Database which holds generated code for SQL Delight 1.0: //Before @Override void onCreate ( SupportSQLiteDatabase db ) { db . execSql ( UserModel . CREATE_TABLE ); db . execSql ( UserModel . INSERTDEFAULTDATA ); // Other create table/initialization } In SQL Delight 1.0 all unlabeled statements in .sq files (including CREATE statements) will be run during onCreate , so we can remove the insertDefaultData identifier from above: User.sq ... --insertDefaultData: INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 1 , 'Alec' ); ... and now your SupportSQLiteOpenHelper.Callback should call into the Database for create @Override void onCreate ( SupportSQLiteDatabase db ) { SqlDriver driver = AndroidSqliteDriver ( db ) Database . Schema . create ( driver ) } You can do the same for your migrations if you place them in .sqm files, but thats not necessary part of the upgrade. At this point things should still work normally. Next add in the code to create your Database as part of an object graph/singleton pattern/whevs: @Provides @Singleton static SupportSQLiteOpenHelper provideDatabaseHelper ( @App Context context ) { SupportSQLiteOpenHelper . Configuration config = SupportSQLiteOpenHelper . Configuration . builder ( context ) . name ( DATABASE_NAME ) . callback ( new MyDatabaseCallback ()) . build (); return new FrameworkSQLiteOpenHelperFactory (). create ( config ); } @Provides @Singleton static Database provideDatabase ( SupportSQLiteOpenHelper helper ) { return new Database ( new AndroidSqliteDriver ( helper )); } If you're also using SQL Brite make sure you create a BriteDatabase with the same SupportSQLiteOpenHelper that's being used to create the Database . Things should still be working. The following assume you're using SQL Brite to get reactive callbacks from the database, but upgrades using only SQL Delight will be similar. Mutating queries can be converted individually by using the Database : before: private val insertUser : UserModel . InsertUser by lazy { UserModel . InsertUser ( datbaseOpenHelper . writableDatabase ) } insertUser . bind ( 2 , \"Jake\" ) insertUser . executeInsert () after: database . userQueries . insertUser ( 2 , \"Jake\" ) You no longer need a \"Factory\" type to perform queries, the query wrapper is all that is needed. before: val query = User . FACTORY . users () val usersObservable = briteDatabase . createQuery ( query . tables , query . statement , query . args ) . mapToList ( User . FACTORY . usersMapper () :: map ) after: val usersObservable = database . userQueries . users () . asObservable ( Schedulers . io ()) // The scheduler to run the query on. . mapToList () If you still want to use a custom type, pass it as a parameter to the query. val myUsersObservable = database . userQueries . users ( :: MyUser ) . asObservable ( Schedulers . io ()) . mapToList () Once you no longer have references to UserModel.java , delete the whole class. Repeat for each of your *Model.java files until upgrading is complete!","title":"Upgrading from Versions before 1.0"},{"location":"1.x/","text":"// rxjava3-extensions rxjava3-extensions Packages Name com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.rx3","title":"rxjava3-extensions   - SQLDelight"},{"location":"1.x/#rxjava3-extensions","text":"","title":"rxjava3-extensions"},{"location":"1.x/#packages","text":"Name com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.rx3","title":"Packages"},{"location":"1.x/android-driver/com.squareup.sqldelight.android/","text":"// android-driver / com.squareup.sqldelight.android Package com.squareup.sqldelight.android Types Name Summary AndroidSqliteDriver [androidJvm] Content class AndroidSqliteDriver : SqlDriver","title":"android-driver"},{"location":"1.x/android-driver/com.squareup.sqldelight.android/#package-comsquareupsqldelightandroid","text":"","title":"Package com.squareup.sqldelight.android"},{"location":"1.x/android-driver/com.squareup.sqldelight.android/#types","text":"Name Summary AndroidSqliteDriver [androidJvm] Content class AndroidSqliteDriver : SqlDriver","title":"Types"},{"location":"1.x/android-driver/com.squareup.sqldelight.android/-android-sqlite-driver/","text":"// android-driver / com.squareup.sqldelight.android / AndroidSqliteDriver AndroidSqliteDriver [androidJvm] class AndroidSqliteDriver : SqlDriver Constructors AndroidSqliteDriver [androidJvm] fun AndroidSqliteDriver (openHelper: SupportSQLiteOpenHelper ) AndroidSqliteDriver [androidJvm] @ JvmOverloads () fun AndroidSqliteDriver (schema: SqlDriver.Schema, context: Context , name: String ?

To include SQLDelight Paging3 extensions: dependencies { implementation \"com.squareup.sqldelight:android-paging3-extensions:1.5.4\" } SQLDelight offers two methods for paging data -- offset based paging and keyset paging. Offset Based Paging Offset paging achieves paged results using OFFSET and LIMIT clauses. Creating a PagingSource that performs offset based paging requires a count query as well as the paged query. countPlayers : SELECT count ( * ) FROM hockeyPlayer ; players : SELECT * FROM hockeyPlayer LIMIT : limit OFFSET : offset ; import com.squareup.sqldelight.android.paging3.QueryPagingSource val pagingSource : PagingSource = QueryPagingSource ( countQuery = playerQueries . countPlayers (), transacter = playerQueries , dispatcher = Dispatchers . IO , queryProvider = playerQueries :: players , ) By default, queries are performed on Dispatchers.IO if no dispatcher is specified. Consumers expecting to use RxJava's Scheduler to perform queries should use the Scheduler.asCoroutineDispatcher extension function. Keyset Paging Offset paging is simple and easy to maintain. Unfortunately it performs poorly on large datasets. The OFFSET clause of a SQL statement really just drops already executed rows in a SQL query. Therefore, as the number to OFFSET grows, so does the amount of time it takes to execute your query. To overcome this, SQLDelight offers a \"keyset paging\" imlementation of PagingSource . Rather than querying an entire dataset and inefficiently dropping the first OFFSET elements, keyset paging operates using a unique column to restrict the bounds of your queries. This performs better at the expense of higher developer maintenance. The queryProvider callback that this paging source accepts has two parameters -- a beginInclusive non-null unique Key as well as an endExclusive nullable unique Key? . An example of the core paging query is shown below. keyedQuery : SELECT * FROM hockeyPlayer WHERE id >= : beginInclusive AND ( id < : endExclusive OR : endExclusive IS NULL ) ORDER BY id ASC ; Queries used in keyset paging must have a unique ordering like shown above. Both beginInclusive and endExclusive are pre-calculated keys that act as page boundaries. Page sizes are established when pre-calculating page boundaries. The pageBoundariesProvider callback takes an anchor: Key? parameter as well as a limit: Long? parameter. An example query that pre-calculates page boundaries is shown below. pageBoundaries : SELECT id FROM ( SELECT id , CASE WHEN (( row_number () OVER ( ORDER BY id ASC ) - 0 ) % : limit ) = 0 THEN 1 WHEN id = : anchor THEN 1 ELSE 0 END page_boundary ; FROM hockeyPlayer ORDER BY id ASC ) WHERE page_boundary = 1 ; Pre-calculating page boundaries of a SQL query will likely require SQLite Window Functions . Window functions were introduced in SQLite version 3.25.0, and therefore are not available by default until Android API 30. To use keyset paging SQLDelight recommends either setting minApi 30 or bundling your own SQLite version. The Requery organization offers an up-to-date distribution of SQLite as a standalone library. The AndroidX paging library allows for the first page fetch to differ in size from the subsequent page fetches with PagingConfig.initialLoadSize . This functionality should be avoided , as the pageBoundariesProvider callback is invoked a single time on the first page fetch. Failing to have matching PagingConifg.initialLoadSize and PagingConfig.pageSize will result in unexpected page boundary generation. This paging source does not support jumping.

If your database is currently on an earlier version, migration files bring those databases up-to-date. If the driver supports it, migrations are run in a transaction. You should not surround your migrations in BEGIN/END TRANSACTION , as this can cause a crash with some drivers. Versioning The first version of the schema is 1. Migration files are named <version to upgrade from>.sqm . To migrate to version 2, put migration statements in 1.sqm : ALTER TABLE hockeyPlayer ADD COLUMN draft_year INTEGER ; ALTER TABLE hockeyPlayer ADD COLUMN draft_order INTEGER ; These SQL statements are run by Database.Schema.migrate() . Migration files go in the same source set as your .sq files. Verifying Migrations You can also place a .db file in the src/main/sqldelight folder of the same <version number>.db format. If there is a .db file present, a new verifySqlDelightMigration task will be added to the gradle project, and it will run as part of the test task, meaning your migrations will be verified against that .db file. It confirms that the migrations yield a database with the latest schema. To generate a .db file from your latest schema, run the generateSqlDelightSchema task, which is available once you specify a schemaOutputDirectory , as described in the gradle.md . You should probably do this before you create your first migration. Code Migrations If you run your migration from code and would like to perform data migrations you can use the Database.Schema.migrateWithCallbacks api: Database . Schema . migrateWithCallbacks ( driver = database , oldVersion = 0 , newVersion = Database .

Schema . migrateWithCallbacks ( driver = database , oldVersion = 0 , newVersion = Database . Schema . version , AfterVersion ( 3 ) { database . execute ( null , \"INSERT INTO test (value) VALUES('hello')\" , 0 ) }, ) Alternatively, it is often useful to receive the SqlDriver as a parameter. In those cases, you can use AfterVersionWithDriver class instead: Database . Schema . migrateWithCallbacks ( driver = database , oldVersion = 0 , newVersion = Database . Schema . version , AfterVersionWithDriver ( 3 ) { it . execute ( null , \"INSERT INTO test (value) VALUES('hello')\" , 0 ) }, ) In the following example, if you have 1.sqm, 2.sqm, 3.sqm, 4.sqm, and 5.sqm as migrations, the above callback will happen after 3.sqm completes when the database is on version 4. After the callback it will resume at 4.sqm and complete the remaining migrations, in this case 4.sqm and 5.sqm, meaning the final database version is 6.","title":"Code Migrations"},{"location":"js_sqlite/multiplatform/","text":"Multiplatform setup with the SqlJs Driver First apply the gradle plugin in your project. buildscript { repositories { google () mavenCentral () } dependencies { classpath 'com.squareup.sqldelight:gradle-plugin:1.5.4' } } apply plugin: 'com.squareup.sqldelight' sqldelight { Database { // This will be the name of the generated database class. packageName = \"com.example\" } } Put your SQL statements in a .sq file under src/main/sqldelight .
